# The Last Sapling
**THE LAST SAPLING** is an action-adventure platformer set in a dystopian future where the world is ruled by **Cybers**, robotic enforcers of the corporate regime. The game explores the collision of **nature** and **technology** in a world where people place their hopes in the **Last Sapling**, believing it will save them from the growing threat of technology. 

As the **Eco Guardian**, the player must protect the sapling, the last hope for real life, and decide if this hope is truly the solution to humanity’s destruction.
 
## Concept/Idea

**THE LAST SAPLING** is inspired by the **CyberGround** theme — a fusion of **cyberpunk** and **nature**. In a world that has been taken over by technology, the environment is slowly deteriorating. The **Cybers**, robotic beings created to maintain order, have replaced real nature, controlling everything from resources to life itself. People place their faith in the **Last Sapling**, believing it is their only hope for protection and restoration of nature.

However, the game delves deeper into the **self-deception** that many face when they place hope in things that cannot truly protect them. The **Eco Guardian**, the protagonist, must confront the truth — is the sapling truly capable of saving the world, or is it just another symbol of false hope in a society unwilling to change?

This game combines the harsh world of cybernetic control with the natural beauty of the **Last Sapling**, showcasing how the **CyberGround** theme is embodied in the narrative and world design.

**Themes Explored**:
- The illusion of protection when one doesn’t truly want to change.
- The idea that hope, when misplaced, can blind us to the reality.
- The human tendency to rely on external forces to fix what can only be fixed from within.


## Storyline

The story is set in a future where the **Cyber Boss** (the player’s father) was the leader of a corporation that controlled the world through technology. In his final days, he started the **plant movement** in an effort to restore real nature, with the **Last Sapling** being the centerpiece of his vision to protect humanity from the digital apocalypse that was beginning to take place.

However, the **Cyber Boss** was betrayed by his own people, and when the truth about his plans was revealed, he was killed. Before his death, he passed on his final words to his child, the **Eco Guardian**: **“Protect the sapling, it is the world’s last hope.”** 

Now, the **Eco Guardian** must protect the sapling and make sure the forces of technology, the **Cybers**, don’t destroy it. The journey is not just about protecting the sapling but understanding the deeper truth: Can anything truly protect you if you don't want to protect yourself?

## Development Process

The game was developed using **Unity** and **C#**, with a core focus on building a world where technology and nature collide. The game’s themes of **self-deception**, **hope**, and **legacy** are reflected in the gameplay and narrative.

1. **Conceptualization**:
   - The central concept of **CyberGround** was to explore how technology (represented by **Cybers**) has overtaken nature. The **Eco Guardian**’s quest to protect the **Last Sapling** reflects the tension between these two worlds.

2. **Prototyping**:
   - Early prototypes focused on creating basic movement and shooting mechanics. The first version of the **robot enemies** was implemented, allowing for combat where players could shoot to defeat them.

3. **Art and Animation**:
   - The art style is heavily influenced by **pixel art**, focusing on the contrast between **natural elements** (like the sapling) and **cyberpunk aesthetics** (neon lights, mechanical robots, dystopian environments). Animations were created to emphasize this fusion.

4. **Gameplay**:
   - The gameplay was designed around navigating through levels where the player must overcome robotic enemies, avoid obstacles, and collect power-ups to progress.
   - **Portal interactions** were added to move between levels, symbolizing transitions between hope and despair.

5. **Final Touches**:
   - The **end screen** was created to show when the player dies. 
   - **UI** elements, including health and score displays, were integrated using **TextMeshPro**.

6. **Testing**:
   - The game underwent multiple rounds of testing to ensure the mechanics, like combat, robot interactions, and level transitions, were working smoothly and reflected the themes properly.
